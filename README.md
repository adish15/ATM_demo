# ATM_demo
backend logic and APIs for ATM functionality where you can select denomination for what note you prefer

1. User validation (PIN and car number will be needed as asked in API)

2. ATM balance and user balance are taken into account with respect to quantity of different type of notes.

3. Additional API made for adding money which too needs user validation.

4. For making atmDetails entry in DB please run script.js once.

Also install node modules

Note:- Do enter your Mongo URI when conecting to mongoose

5. I have also taken into account on how number of notes will be deducted from total notes present in ATM.

6. And  have done checks for amount entered plus the denomination selected.

7. As discussed on mail, I have made APIs. let me know if frontend is needed.
